# AI-Agent

I am using CrewAi Framework to implement AI Agents.

CrewAi is a framework for creating teams of self-thinking artificial intelligence agents. These agents can work together to achieve a common goal, such as planning a meeting or creating a business plan.

**Components of Crew.ai**

CrewAi has four main components:

* **Tasks:** Define what the agents need to do to achieve the goal.
* **Agents:** The individual agents that perform the tasks.
* **Tools:** Resources that the agents can use to complete their tasks.
* **Process:** The order in which the tasks are completed.

**How Agents Think**

CrewAi agents use a loop-based thought process to complete their tasks. They:

* Enter a thought cycle with a context.
* Think about the task and create an action to take.
* Execute the action and receive an observation.
* Append the observation to the context.
* Repeat the cycle until they complete the task.

**Example: Planning a Meeting**

Consider a crew of agents responsible for planning a meeting:

* The Researcher agent analyzes the participants and industry.
* The Industry Analyst identifies trends and challenges.
* The Meeting Strategist develops talking points.
* The Summarizer compiles a meeting summary.

The agents communicate with each other to gather information and make decisions.

**Costs and Monitoring**

Executing CrewAi tasks can be expensive due to language model calls. To monitor costs and usage, you can use Langsmith. It logs agent thoughts, actions, and costs.

**Conclusion**

CrewAi enables the development of self-thinking AI agents that can collaborate effectively. By understanding its components, how agents work, and the associated costs, you can create powerful crews to automate complex tasks.
